   # Terminal 1 - Start server
   cd server
   npm start

   # Terminal 2 - Start client
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

## Making Changes

### Branch Strategy

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the code style guidelines

3. **Test your changes**:

   ```bash
   # Client linting
   cd client
   npm run lint

   # Build test
   npm run build
   ```

### Code Style Guidelines

#### TypeScript/React (Client)

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Use functional components with hooks
- Add proper TypeScript types for all props and functions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

#### JavaScript/Node.js (Server)

- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Add JSDoc comments for all functions
- Use proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Follow RESTful API conventions

#### General Guidelines

- **Indentation**: 2 spaces
- **Quotes**: Single quotes for strings
- **Semicolons**: Always use semicolons
- **Line length**: Keep lines under 100 characters
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex logic
- **Naming**: Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for components

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```

docs: update installation instructions
style: format code with prettier
refactor: improve error handling in API utils
```
